git notes

need to do a git pull on the master repo to get submodule changes

  $ git pull

init and update everything

  $git submodule update --init --recursiv

easier git diff - TODO

Now if you go back into the main project and run git diff --submodule you can
see that the submodule was updated and get a list of commits that were added to
it. If you don’t want to type --submodule every time you run git diff, you can
set it as the default format by setting the diff.submodule config value to
“log”.

fetch and update everything

   $git submodule update --remote

   NOTE it assumes master. Set branch in .gitmodules to change.

   or set it via git config -f .gitmodules submodule.DbConnector.branch stable
